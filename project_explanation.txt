RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) System - Project Overview
=======================================================

Introduction
------------
This project implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with a modern React-based frontend and a secure backend infrastructure. The system demonstrates advanced authentication and authorization mechanisms while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

Technical Stack
--------------
Frontend:
- React with TypeScript
- Chakra UI for component styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API communication

Backend:
- Cloudflare Workers
- JWT for secure authentication
- RESTful API architecture

Security Implementation
----------------------

1. Authentication System
-----------------------
- Secure user registration with email and password
- JWT-based authentication system
- Protected route middleware
- Secure session management
- Axios interceptors for automatic token handling
- Logout functionality with token invalidation

2. Authorization & RBAC
----------------------
Implemented three distinct user roles:
- ADMIN: Full system access
- MODERATOR: Limited administrative capabilities
- USER: Basic access rights

Role-specific features:
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Component-level access control
- Role-based UI adaptation
- Hierarchical permission structure

3. Security Best Practices
-------------------------
- Password hashing for secure storage
- JWT token-based authentication
- Protected API endpoints
- CORS protection
- Request/Response interceptors
- Error handling and logging
- Secure HTTP-only cookies
- XSS protection through React's built-in mechanisms

Key Features
-----------
1. User Management
   - User registration with role selection
   - Secure login/logout
   - Profile management
   - Role-based dashboard access

2. Access Control
   - Route protection based on roles
   - Dynamic UI rendering based on permissions
   - Protected API endpoints
   - Role-specific features

API Endpoints & Data Flow
------------------------
1. Authentication Endpoints
   - POST /auth/register: User registration
     - Validates email and password
     - Hashes password using bcrypt
     - Stores user data in KV store
     - Returns JWT token

   - POST /auth/login: User authentication
     - Validates credentials
     - Returns JWT token with user role
     - Sets session data

   - POST /auth/logout: Session termination
     - Invalidates current token
     - Clears session data

2. Protected Endpoints
   - GET /api/user/profile: User profile data
     - Requires valid JWT
     - Returns user-specific information

   - GET /api/admin: Admin-only data
     - Requires ADMIN role
     - Returns administrative information

   - GET /api/moderator: Moderator access
     - Requires MODERATOR role
     - Returns moderation tools

Data Storage (Cloudflare KV)
---------------------------
1. User Data Structure
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "unique-uuid",
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "passwordHash": "bcrypt-hashed-password",
     "role": "USER|ADMIN|MODERATOR",
     "createdAt": "timestamp",
     "lastLogin": "timestamp"
   }
   ```

2. KV Store Organization
   - Users:{userId}: Stores user profile data
   - Sessions:{sessionId}: Manages active sessions
   - Roles:{roleId}: Stores role permissions
   - Tokens:{token}: Tracks valid JWT tokens

3. Data Operations
   - Create: Atomic operations for new user registration
   - Read: Fast key-value lookups for authentication
   - Update: Atomic updates for profile changes
   - Delete: Immediate invalidation for logouts

4. Performance Optimization
   - Cached reads for frequent access patterns
   - Batch writes for bulk operations
   - TTL for session management
   - Index-based queries for user lookup

5. Security Measures
   - Encrypted storage
   - Rate limiting per key
   - Backup and recovery procedures
   - Access logging and monitoring

Code Organization
----------------
The project follows a modular architecture:

1. Components
   - Reusable UI components
   - Protected route wrapper
   - Layout components

2. Context
   - Authentication context for global state
   - User role management

3. Services
   - API service layer
   - Authentication service
   - Role-based service segregation

4. Types
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Role enums
   - Shared types

5. Pages
   - Role-specific pages
   - Public pages
   - Protected dashboards

Testing & Security Validation
---------------------------
The system can be tested using the following credentials:

1. Admin Access:
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: password123

2. Regular User:
   - Email: user@example.com
   - Password: password123
